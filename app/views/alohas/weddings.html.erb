    <h1>Weddings</h1>
    <p class="lead">
          For many couples, their wedding day is one of the most important days of their lives. The right music can help turn the occasion in the celebration of a lifetime! For over 10 years, I have had the privilege of playing music in many weddings. From intimate ceremonies on the beach to ballroom parties, I have tried my best to perfect the art of adding a touch of Hawaiâ€™i to the atmosphere of any type of celebration.
